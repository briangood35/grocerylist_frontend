# Collaborative Grocery List - Front End
### This repository contains the front end code for my collaborative grocery list. When an item is added to or removed from the grocery list, other users connected to the same back end can see the updated items.

## If connecting to back end running locally

To run the app, run `npm start`.

## If connecting to remote back end

To run the app, set `REACT_APP_API_ADDR` environment variable to the end point. Then run `npm start`. This can be done in one command with `REACT_APP_API_ADDR=your_end_point npm start`.
